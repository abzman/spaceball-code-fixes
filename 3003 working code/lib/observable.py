# the basic pipeline comes from the good old Observer pattern,
# but we have a wrinkle.  In order to handle even moderately
# deep pipelines in such a memory-starved environment, we change
# the nomenclature; a PipelineStage is intended to be part of a
# multistage transformation of data; at any point on that, we
# can attach an observer to report on it.

# the PipelineStages are aggregated into a Pipeline; at every
# stage *if* the stage emits a new message, the Pipeline
# gathers that, sends it to that stage's observers, and
# then iterates and sends that as the input to the next stage.

# the end result is we avoid the stack at the expense of
# elegance.

# Historically this was changed because while it was possible
# to increase the stack space in CircuitPython, it only appeared
# to have an effect after one soft reboot, which made it fail
# on initial run.  This appears to have fixed the problem.
